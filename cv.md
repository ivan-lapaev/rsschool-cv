#Briefly About Myself:

I changed many fields of activity, I worked in trade, sales, restaurant business. I was looking for myself, something new and interesting that would inspire, and the pleasure that comes from getting high on a job or project, solving problems and looking for ways to get them done. So I decided to realize my old dream - to become a Frontend Developer. I consider perseverance and diligence as my main qualities, which will help me on the way to mastering a new profession.

I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.
